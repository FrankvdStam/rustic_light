Everyone with a gaming pc knows, these days, you have 100 different rgb related programs and they all install 70 different bloatware packages that you never asked for. Even when you pay a serious premium for the hardware that contains the rgb puke in the first place, so you spend big money and get some crapware. End rant.

This is the code that I'm using on my own pc with my own hardware to get the rgb puke in sync. This might not be directly usefull to you, unless you have the exact same hardware, but it might be nice to take a peek under the hood and see how to potentially talk to your GPU with nvapi.

Running this code is at your own discretion. During development there was a period where the LED's on my motherboard didn't work anymore... No warranties whatsoever. Run at your own risk.
